    "Description": "This car has lived a typical life down in India: drove for 35 years with basically no maintenance, the engine oil is composed of tandoori chicken and cumin. Being stuck between 16 000 000 buses everyday certainly does not help in keeping a car in nice shape. Dont worry about the transmission's whines and the mattress on the roof, its normal things in India.",
